You will be given an HTML document, containing an article and a button. Some parts of the text will be highlighted with a <strong> tag. Write a JS function that receives a selector to the button and attaches an event to it. The event executes a function that finds all highlighted parts of the text and places them in a summary after the original article. The article will always be inside a div with ID 'content'.
The summary should be inside a div with ID 'summary', appended after the original article (at the end of its parent). The first element inside the div is a heading (<h2>) with the text 'Summary'. The second element is a paragraph (<p>), inside which are all the extracted parts from the original article. Note that you only need the text without the <strong> tags that originally surround it. See the example for more details.
