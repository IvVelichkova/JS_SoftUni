Write Mocha tests to
 verify the functionality of the following JS code:

 Your tests will be supplied with a class named SortedList. It needs to meet the following requirements:
 Maintains a collection of numeric elements
 Has an add(element) function, which adds a new element to the collection
 Has a remove(index) function, which removes the element at position index
 Has a get(index) function, which return the value of the element at position index
 Keeps the elements of the collection sorted in ascending order at all times
 Throws an error if the functions get() and remove() are supplied with an invalid index (negative or outside the collection) or if the collection is empty
 Has a size() property getter, which returns the number of elements inside the collection
 Note
 Submit your tests inside a describe() statement, using the Unit Tests with Sinon and Mocha Judge strategy.
